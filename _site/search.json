Associate Investigators: Dr. James Bell, Dr. Pim Bongaerts, Dr. Sarah Bury\nPostdoctoral Researchers: Dr. Francesca Strano\nResearch Assistants: Dr. Chelsey Beese, Matteo Collina\nPhD Students: Emma Novak, Mollie Rickwood\n\n\n\nTemperate mesophotic ecosystems (TMEs) are the “twilight zone” of our oceans, found at depths of 30–150 metres where little sunlight remains. Unlike shallow seas dominated by seaweeds, TMEs are rich in sponges, sea fans, and other animals adapted to low light. These habitats create complex structures that support diverse marine life, including fish and crustaceans, and may provide refuges from marine heatwaves and other climate impacts.\nDespite their ecological and economic importance, TMEs remain under-researched and vulnerable to threats like fishing, sedimentation, and physical disturbance. Our Marsden Fund project uses new technology—such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)—to explore, document, and model these unique ecosystems, aiming to inform their protection and management for the future.\nLearn more: Into the ocean twilight zone: how new technology is revealing the secrets of an under-researched undersea world (The Conversation/Greenpeace)"

    "text": "What We Do\nOur research spans deep sea, shallow-water, and coastal communities, with a particular focus on how climate change and human activities affect fish populations and fisheries. Combining field data collection with advanced ecosystem modelling, we investigate how habitat change and degradation influence both tropical and temperate fish communities—from coral reefs to kelp forests. Our goal is to promote long-term sustainability by providing robust scientific tools and insights for ecosystem and fisheries managers, supporting the conservation and responsible management of marine resources.\nWe collaborate with many organisations, including Wellington City Council, the Department of Conservation (DOC), NIWA, and the Save Our Seas Foundation.\n\nExplore our research, meet our people, and get involved!\n{width=420px style=“display:block;margin:2rem auto 1rem auto;border-radius:18px;}"

    "text": "Senior Lecturer in Fisheries Biology\nDirector, Victoria University Coastal Ecology Lab\nAlice is a marine ecologist and quantitative fisheries scientist. She leads the MEEM Lab and the Coastal Ecology Lab at Victoria University of Wellington. Her research focuses on how climate change, fisheries, and other stressors impact coastal ecosystems, and how management can be improved to ensure these ecosystems survive and thrive for future generations. Alice completed her PhD at Imperial College London in 2011, studying the population dynamics of Caribbean sea urchins. Originally from central England, she has worked and dived in the UK, Honduras, French Polynesia, Australia, and New Zealand. Alice is passionate about interdisciplinary, collaborative science and works closely with iwi, government, and community partners. She is committed to mentoring students and fostering equity and diversity in marine science. Alice’s favourite fish is the harlequin sweetlips (Plectorhinchus chaetodonoides)."
