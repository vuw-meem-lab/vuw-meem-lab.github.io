Temperate mesophotic ecosystems (TMEs) are the "twilight zone" of our oceans, found at depths of 30–150 metres where little sunlight remains. Unlike shallow seas dominated by seaweeds, TMEs are rich in sponges, sea fans, and other animals adapted to low light. These habitats create complex structures that support diverse marine life, including fish and crustaceans, and may provide refuges from marine heatwaves and other climate impacts.

Despite their ecological and economic importance, TMEs remain under-researched and vulnerable to threats like fishing, sedimentation, and physical disturbance. Our Marsden Fund project uses new technology—such as remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)—to explore, document, and model these unique ecosystems, aiming to inform their protection and management for the future.

### Climate change at the end of the earth: sevengill sharks in Fiordland, New Zealand
**Funding:** Save Our Seas Foundation

This project aims to understand how climate change and extreme weather events will impact the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) in Fiordland, New Zealand. Sevengill sharks are a key top predator, recently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and play a vital role in coastal ecosystems. The project investigates how changes in water temperature, salinity, and prey availability affect the sharks’ movements, habitat use, and survival, with the goal of informing management to ensure their future.
